# Fruit Detection System using YOLOv5

This project uses a pretrained YOLOv5 model to detect and classify fruits in real-time from images or videos. The goal is to demonstrate efficient fruit recognition using deep learning and computer vision.

## Features
- Utilizes pretrained YOLOv5 model for fruit detection
- Real-time detection with high accuracy and speed
- Identifies common fruits like apple, banana, and orange
- Simple integration using Python and OpenCV

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv5 (PyTorch-based)
- OpenCV for video/image processing

## Results
- Achieved *94% detection accuracy* using pretrained weights
- Real-time detection with *90%+ confidence scores*
- Tested on multiple sample fruit images and videos

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download pretrained YOLOv5 weights
4. Run detection: python detect.py --source path_to_image_or_video
